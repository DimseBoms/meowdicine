# Meowdicine

Meowdicine is a medicine reminder application that I made for animals that need daily medicines of any kind. I got the idea because it can be difficult to coordinate giving my cat medicine when we are multiple owners.

The application allows you to create profiles for your pets, add their medications and schedules, and receive notifications when itâ€™s time to give them their doses. You can also track their history to see whether they have missed any previous doses.

The main goal of this project was for me to practice flutter, but it should also make it easier and more convenient for pet owners to take care of their furry friends who need special attention and care.
